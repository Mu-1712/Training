1. Import Data
2. Data Cleansing - use Power Query
	2a. Replace "Jan Morforth\" with "Jan Morforth"
	2b. Replace "United States" with "US"
	2c. Change DataType of Amount and Boxes
	2d. Remove Spaces by Transform - Trim
	2e. Replace 'null' with 'Special'

3. Table View - Create Table dim_Date = Calendar(Date(2022,1,1),Date(2023,12,1))
4. Build Data Model - Star Schema
5. DAX:
	5a. New Measure on Sales Table:  Total Amount = Sum(Sales[Amount])
	5b. 'Card' Visualization and Use Measure "TotalAmount"
 	5c. Add Table Visual - Add Geography and "Total Amount"
	5d. Format Measure

Calculate Total Boxes
	6. New Measure: Total Boxes = Sum(Sales[Boxes])

Calculate Total Shipments:
	7. New Measure: Shipment Count = CountRows(Sales) / SQL Query : SELECT COUNT(*) AS ShipmentCount FROM Fact_Sales
	8. Add Slizer - Category
Evaluation Context

Measures are Reusable:
Calculate Amount per Shipment - Normal way (Lazy Way)
	9. New Measure: Amount Per Shipment = Sum(Sales[Amount])/CountRows(Sales)
Calculate APS 2 - Reuseability ( Faster and More Optimized way)
	10. New Measure: ApS 2 = [Total Amount]  / [Shipment Count]
Calculate Amount Per Box
	11. New Measures: ApB = [Total Amount]  / [Total Boxes] - Best Practice
Calculate APB 2 - Div/0 Error & Divide() Function
	12. #Div Error: New Measure: ApB 2 = divide([Total Amount],[Total Boxes],"No Boxes")
	13. Page 2 - Drag Table - Sales Person, ApB2, ApS2

If() function in DAX
14. Met Target: New Measure: ApS Target Achieved? = if([ApS 2] > 4800,"Yes","No")
	14.1 Measures are Aggregates - Single Value(number/text)
	
FUN DAX Trick - Visual Indicator
- Emoji "Windows Key" + "."

	15. Fun Trick: New Measure: ApS Target Achieved 2 = if([ApS 2] > 4800,Windows+. ":)",":(")

	16. Add Slizer - Geography

- Next level of understanding DAX Language
Calculate Products sales by Sales Person
	17. Page 3 - Drag Table Which Sales Person Sells Which Products ? New Measure Count of Products = countrows(Products)
	18. New Measure: Count of Products (right) = [_Shipment Count]
	19. New Measure: Min, Max, Average
	20. New Page 4- Drag Table - Product/Sales Person, Shipment Count

Calculate Low Box Shipment Box (count of # Box below 50)
	21. New Measure: # Boxes under 50 Low Box Shipment Count = Calculate(CountRows(Sales),sales [Boxes]<50)
				MySQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Sales WHERE Boxes < 50
Calculate LBS %
	22. New Measure: LBS % = Divide([Low Box Shipment Count],[Shipment Count])
Calculate Bar Shipment & % 
	23. New Measure: Bar Shipments = Calculate([Shipment Count],Product[Category]="Bars")
				MySQL = SELECT p.Product,COUNT(*) from sales s
					INNER JOIN Product p ON s.Product = p.Product
					WHERE p.Category = "Bars"
					GROUP BY p.Product
				Order of Execution: FROM > Where > Group By > Having > Select > Order By

	24. New Measure: Bar Shipment % = Divide([Bar Shipments],[Shipment Count])

Page level filter -- To verify for "Bars"

Power of Calculate() function: 
Calculate Americas Shipment - Overrides Page filter
	25. Page Filter for APAC
	26. Power of Calculate New Shipments: Americas Shipments = Calculate([Shipment Count], locations[Region]="North America")

28. Row Context - In Sales Table - New Column: Weekday = Weekday(sales[Date])
	27. Page 5- Drag Table - Product, TotalAmount, Friday Amount
	28. New Measure: Friday Amount = Calculate([Total Amount], Sales[Weekday]=6)
	29. New Measure: Friday Amount 2 = [Total Amount](Sales[Weekday]=6)

Variables in DAX:
	30. New Measure: NZAU Sales Amount = 
			var nzAmount = Calculate([Total Amount],KeepFilters(locations[Geo] = "New Zealand"))
			var auAmount = Calculate([Total Amount],KeepFilters(locations[Geo] = "Australia"))
			return
				nzAmount + auAmount
	31. New Page 5 - Column Chart - Total Amount by Geo
Using Or Condition:
	32. New Measure: NZAU Sales Amount 2 =  Calculate([Total Amount], location in {"New Zealand","Australia"})

		SQL Query: Select Sum(Amount) FROM Fact_Sales AS t1
				INNER JOIN Dim_Geo AS t2 On t1.Country = t2.Country
			   WHERE t2.Country IN ('Australia','New Zealand')
